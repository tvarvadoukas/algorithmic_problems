A number c of literary critics were asked "Which of the popular novels are masterpieces"? Their 
choices ignited fervent discussions among readers. The moment is speculated by the p = c div 2 
television stations that decide to organize, simultaneously and independently, talk-shows, each 
inviting exactly two critics. The television stations pay critics for exclusivity - no critic can 
appear in two different stations, but the amounts paid out are so high that no television station 
can invite more than two critics.

Given that the television stations' sponsors require that before and after their commercials there 
are no fights or tensioned moments, each television station is required to invite critics with 
similar but not identical opinions on which novel is a masterpiece - hence for each two invited 
critics their options must differ by exactly one novel.

Given c (the number of critics) and r (the number of novels), 1 <= c <= 100, 1<= r <= 20, together 
with the list of novels considered great by each critic, help them giving one of the possible 
solution such as the most television stations can host talk-shows.

Input From STDIN you will read the amount of critics c and number of novels r, separated by space, 
on a single line. On the i+1-th line (1 = i <= c) you have the list of masterpieces suggested by 
critic i, as a series of at most r different integers between 1 and r, separated by space. The input 
data is well formed and correct.

Output On STDOUT you will write the number t, representing the number of television stations that 
can host talk-shows; on the next t lines you will write the two critics (each numbered between 1 to 
c) of the critics attending the show. Execution time/test: maximum 2 seconds.
